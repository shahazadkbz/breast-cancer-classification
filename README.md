# Breast Cancer Classification

This project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** to build and compare multiple machine learning models that classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.  
The goal is to evaluate different algorithms and identify the best-performing one.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset  
- **Target Variable**: `Class` (2 = Benign, 4 = Malignant)  
- **Features**: 9 numeric attributes related to cell characteristics  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**  
4. **Model Training** (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes)  
5. **Evaluation** (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
6. **Comparison Plot of All Models**
